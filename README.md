# j4_ajax_test_component

Test joomla response on ajax call feedback generated by actions on the server code side

Intention:

Purpose: Display the results of a ajax call for several situations like
 * return with json data
 * return with enqueue message (warning, ...)
 * return with error (after throw)
 * return with echo before
 * return with several of above at the same time

> The results will be displayed in separate areas of the form.<br>
> There will be selectors to choose different server handlings.
